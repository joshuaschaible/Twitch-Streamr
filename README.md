stream-list-twitch
==================

Grabs users from Twitch and plays their live stream (like speedrunslive.com)


How It Works

For the most part, the script is entirely automatic. The only areas that need to be adjusted are the users youâ€™re looking to pull in. With the standalone version, simply replace the users below within the script.js file. You can add as many or as little as you like:
var members = ['FunForFreedom', 'SuperMCGamer', 'Miketheguyinthehat', 'ChocoPoptartftw', 'Koopatroopa1', 'Jim3798', 'Lucarimew', 'Purple_link432', 'TeddyMoose', 'LetsNarvik', 'Wilicolo', 'Lizerdoo', 'SilverDSlite', 'Zelda_queen', 'IceKrabby', 'Animejessica', 'Charissachu', 'MutatedPuppet', 'MLGCOD', '123412341234123412341234123'];
