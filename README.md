Twitch Streamr


How It Works
==================

== Automatic ==
This pulls in all the members under a specific team. Just change the team name in lines 257 and 258:

$query="funforfreedom";
$name="funforfreedom";


== Manual ==
For the most part, the script is entirely automatic. The only areas that need to be adjusted are the users youâ€™re looking to pull in. With the standalone version, simply replace the users below within the twitch-stream.js file. You can add as many or as little as you like:

var members = ['FunForFreedom', 'SuperMCGamer', 'Miketheguyinthehat', 'ChocoPoptartftw', 'Koopatroopa1', 'Jim3798', 'Lucarimew', 'Purple_link432', 'TeddyMoose', 'LetsNarvik', 'Wilicolo', 'Lizerdoo', 'SilverDSlite', 'Zelda_queen', 'IceKrabby', 'Animejessica', 'Charissachu', 'MutatedPuppet', 'MLGCOD', '123412341234123412341234123'];


== Wordpress Plugin ==
